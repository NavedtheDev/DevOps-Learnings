* Suppose two people X and Y are trying to contribute to the same in a project.

* But X was a bit quicker and merged the changes into ther main. Now Y wants to merge his changes into the main branch. But the main branch contains changes compared to the Y branch in the file that we are currently trying to merge. Now git doesn't know which one to keep. We just ended up ina merge conflict. 

* There are several ways to resolve this conflict. 

* Main branch will then contain a combination of X's and Y's changes.
