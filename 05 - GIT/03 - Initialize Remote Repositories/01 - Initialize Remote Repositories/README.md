* A connection string is a URL that we can use in order to let git know where the remote repository is located. 

* We can add the remote repository to our local project with the git remote add command. 

* We want to add a remote repository and give it the alias origin to make sure that we always know which remote repository we are pushing to without having to memorize the entire connection string. In order to do so, use the command,

```
git remote add origin <connection_string>
```

* To list all the remote repositories use,

```
git remote -v
```
