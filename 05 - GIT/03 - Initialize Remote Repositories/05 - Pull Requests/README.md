* Till now we saw that we can merge branches directly into the main branch. But when we work in a team, we do not follow that way. 

* We will push our changes to a separate branch other than main branch using the git push command. 

* After pushing to that branch, check the GitHub repo and you will see a pop-up in which option of 'Pull request' will be present. In order to merge our branch to the main branch, we need to open a Pull request. We can do that by clicking on the Pull request button.

* After clickning on that button you will see the changes that were made on that branch compared to the main branch and a button to create a pull request. We can add additional information about the changes that we have made.

* When a pull request is opened other team members can see the chnages that you have made and comments on them. 

* To avoid that anyone can merge the changes into the main branch, you need to have the right privileges to do so. 
 
* If you are working in a team, then you may need to ask other team members to merge your PR.
