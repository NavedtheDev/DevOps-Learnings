* Let's initialize a local GIT repository. We can do so with the following command,

```
git init
```

* To list all the contents of the folder including hidden ones, use

```
ls -a 
```
You will see that a .git folder has been created. 

* Suppose you created a file and added some content to it. Now you want to check the status of GIT, use

```
git status
```
