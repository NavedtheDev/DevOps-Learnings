* Git is an open source distributed version control system. 

* Git is a content tracker, it stores all our code changes.

* A version control system means that we acn go back in time and work with a different version of our code base since Git stored it all and work with branches.

* Distributed means that it has a remote repository, which is stored in a server and a local repository, which is stored on the computer of every developer working on a project. Every developer has access to the full copy of the code base.

* With Git, we can go back in time without losing any new changes. 

* When we have made changes, we can save the current state of the website. This way we always have all our versions stored, which makes it easy to go back in time. 

* We have access to the project's full history, the changes we made, who made the changes, if we are working on a project with multiple team members, and when it was made. 

* Use this command to get basic git commands,

```
git help
```
