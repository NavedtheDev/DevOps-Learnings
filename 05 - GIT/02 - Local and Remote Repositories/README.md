* Git has two repository types, <b>local</b> and <b>remote</b>.

## Local Repository ##

* It is on your own machine, so you have direct access to it. 

## Remote Repository ##

* It is usually a centralized server and is entirely optional. 

* We can save the changes that we made locally on this remote server. 

* It is very useful when you want to have a backup of your data.

* Teammates can initialize their own local repository, on their own computers, and simply pull the data from the remote repository in order to start working on your project. 

* When a team member has made changes, they can push these changes to the remote repository. 

<b>NOTE: </b> In order to keep your local and remote repository in sync, you can then pull these changes from the remote repository into your local repository.
