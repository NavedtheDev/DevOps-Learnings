* It can happen that one branch has a commit with a certain change that you like to apply to another branch, but you don't want all the changes that were made to that branch. 

* In this case, we can cherry pick that certain commit in order to create a copy of that commit onto our own branch. 

* Use the command,

```
git cherry-pick <hash_ID_of_the_commit>
```

* We now have the copy of that commit on our branch.
