* Imagine you're working on a feature branch called "feature/branch" based on the "main" branch in a collaborative project. While you were developing your feature, other team members made several commits and merged them into the "main" branch. Now, you want to incorporate those changes into your feature branch before completing your work.

* One way to do that is to merge the main branch into your own branch. This creates a new merge commit to merge these changes into your own branch. But there is another way.

* Instead of merging the "main" branch into your feature branch, you can use rebasing to integrate the latest changes into your branch. 

* By rebasing your feature branch onto the "main" branch, you create a linear commit history without the extra merge commits that would result from a regular merge. This can provide a cleaner and more organized commit history.

* However, it's important to note that if you have already shared your feature branch with other team members or pushed it to a remote repository, it's generally not recommended to rebase it.
