* Operators are symbols that help us to perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operands. 
* For example, when we say a+b, the addition sign here is the operator, while a and b are the operands. 
* In Golang, we can define operators of five types, 
   
   1. Comparison operators
   2. Arithmetic operators 
   3. Assignment operators
