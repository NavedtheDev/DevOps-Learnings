* Some expressions we learned earlier may not work in every other shell. If you share your script with others, then you must specify the shell it runs in. That is where Shebnag can help.

* A Shebang statement is a line that you specify at the top of a shell script. It starts with a hash followed by an exclamation mark and then the path to a shell. 

* A Shebang is used to specify what shell a script must run in. 

* This way whenever the script is run, it would always run in the bash shell and the end users need not have to specify which shell to run on. 

* The Shebang instructs the shell to use a particular shell or interpreter for the script. 

* One of the best practice while developing a shell script is to always start with a Shebang at the top of your script.
