* When we want our script to behave differently based on a condition, we use conditional logic. 

* For this we use 'if' statement, after that we have the 'then' statement and then the block is closed with the 'fi' statement. 

* The condition of an if statement is encapsulated under a pair of square brackets. 

* We can also add an else if statement within a block, but it is called 'elif'. Finally we can add an else block at the end that will be run if none of the above conditions are met.

* Example,

## Comparison statements ##

* They should be within square brackets, and there should be atleast one between the brackets and your statement, as well as the operator and the values on either side. 

* The equal operator is only to be used to compare strings. Here is a list of other comparison operators.

* There is another way of specifying a conditional operation and that's using double square brackets. These work similar to the single pair of squrae brackets, except that it is an enhanced version and support additional operations. Here is the list,
