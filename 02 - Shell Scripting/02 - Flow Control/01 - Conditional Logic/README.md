* When we want our script to behave differently based on a condition, we use conditional logic. 

* For this we use 'if' statement, after that we have the 'then' statement and then the block is closed with the 'fi' statement. 

* The condition of an if statement is encapsulated under a pair of square brackets. 

* We can also add an else if statement within a block, but it is called 'elif'. Finally we can add an else block at the end that will be run if none of the above conditions are met.
