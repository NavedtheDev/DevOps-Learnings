* A data type is a classification made on the kind of data. They categorize a set of related values, describe the operations that can be done on them. 

* Why do we need a datatype ? We need them for basically three reasons : <br>
          
          1. categorize a set of related values <br>
          2. describe the operations that can be done on them <br>
          3. define the way the data is stored <br>


* Different data types are dicussed below.



# Integers #

* Integers can be defined in Golang using many keywords, but the most used is simply int. Int over here refers to signed integers, which means both positive and negative numbers. Example could be -90, 0, 27, etc.
