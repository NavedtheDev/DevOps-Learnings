* Functions are self-contained units of code which carry out a certain job. 

* They help us divide a program into small manageable, repeatable and organisable chunks. 

## Why use functions? ##

* <b>Reusablility:</b> We define a function once and then can call it multiple times. 

* <b>Abstraction:</b> Functions can be used to abstract their inner implemetations.
