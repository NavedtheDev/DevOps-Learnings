* Comparison Operators compare two operands and yield a Boolean value that is true or false. 
* They allow values of the same data type for comparisons and return true if it matches the comparison and false if it does not. 
* We have the following Comparison Operators in Golang,

    1. Equal (==)
    2. Not equal (!=)
    3. Less than (<)
    4. Less than equal to (<=)
    5. greater than (>)
    6. Greater than equal to (>=)
