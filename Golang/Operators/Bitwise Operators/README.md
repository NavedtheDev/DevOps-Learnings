* Bitwise Operators are a bit different from the other operators. Bitwise operators work at bit level or perform bit by bit operation. 
* We have the following bitwise operators in Golang:
   
   1. bitwise AND ( & )
   2. bitwise OR ( | )
   3. bitwise XOR ( ^ )
   4. right shift ( >> )
   5. left shift ( << )
   
   
## bitwise AND (&) ##

* This operator takes two numbers as operands and does AND operation on every bit of two numbers. 
* Let's see how bitwise AND is going to work for 12 and 25.

## bitwise OR (|) ##

* Bitwise OR takes two numbers as operand and does OR on every bit of two numbers.
