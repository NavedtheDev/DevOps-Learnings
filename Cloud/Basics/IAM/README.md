* When we create an account on AWS, it uses an email, that is know as a root account. That account has complete privileges to your AWS account. So it's a very powerful user, infact it's very difficult to restrict the privileges of the root account.
* Therefore, AWS recommends that you don'yt use this account for everydat usage. Instead you should create your own user accounts for yourself and for your employees. The service we use for that is known as the AWS Identity and Access Management service.
