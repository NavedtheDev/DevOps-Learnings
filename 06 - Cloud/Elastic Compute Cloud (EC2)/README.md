* Amazon EC2 is a compute service that allows you to run virtualized servers on AWS. 

* With EC2, you are running what we call instances. So an instance is kind of like a virtual server or a virtual machine running on AWS.

* As we learnt that an instance is essentially like a virtual machine. So it will have a certain amount of CPU, RAM, Drive space and the network interface. Then it will have an operating system and then it can have some applications which you install.

* Now, an EC2 instance will need an IP Address. So, there are three different types of IP Address that your instance can obtain.
