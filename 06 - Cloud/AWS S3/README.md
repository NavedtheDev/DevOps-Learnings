* S3 stands for Simple Storage Service. It provides an infinitely scalable storage solution from AWS. It also offers high availability of data by storing it across multiple devices and availability zones in a region. 

* It is an object based storage. 

* In S3, data is stored in the form of an S3 bucket. A bucket can be considered as a container or a directory which stores all your files. We can create as many of these buckets as we need in our AWS account.
