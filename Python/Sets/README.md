* Unlike Lists datatype, Sets datatype doesn't allow storing duplicate values.
* set( ) function is used to convert an existing list into a set. The parameter of our set( ) function will be the list.
* Lists is represented using [ ] brackets whereas sets is represented using { } brackets.

* Here is an example on how you can create sets in your program.

```
my_set = {"January", "February", "March"}

```
* However, we cannot access elements of a set like we did on lists. Items in a set set do not have a defined order. 
* Instead we can only access the elements of a set in a loop.
