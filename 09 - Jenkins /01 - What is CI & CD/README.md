* Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery is a way to take code, package it up and deploy it to a system. That system could be anything like a VM, an EC2, etc.

## What is CI? ##

* Continuous Integration, in this you take the code and you package it up. Think of it like a gift that you are wrapping. Suppose the gify comes to you in pieces, once you recieve that you put that together. And then you wrap it in a wrapping paper. That's your CI process. You are taking the code, you are packaging it up, and then you give it to the CD process.

* There are a few kry pieces of CI.

  1. The first is, you package up that code. Let us say you are in your GitHub, and you have a GitHub repository and that repo has different folders or directories with diffreent pieces of code in it. Inside of your CI process, it does a clone of that GitHub repository.
