* The Linux shell is a program that allows text-based interaction between the user and the operating system. This interaction is carried out by typing commands into the interface and receiving the response in the same way. 
* The Linux shell is a powerful tool with which you can navigate between different locations within the system. When you log into the shell, the very first directory you are taken to is your home directory. 
* /home is a system created directory that contains the home directories for almost all users in the Linux system. 
* Why do we need a home directory? The home directory allows users to store their personal data in the form of files and directories. Each user in the system gets their own unique home directory with complete access to it, to be able to save, retrieve, or delete data. 
* Another thing to note is the representation of the home directory. It is represented by the tilde symbol ( ~ ) in the command line.
