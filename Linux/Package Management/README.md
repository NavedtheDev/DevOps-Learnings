* Let us first understand what a package is. A package, in its simplest definition, is a compressed archive that contains all the files that are required by a particular software to run. 

* A package manager is a software in a Linux system that provides a consistent and automated process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing packages from the operating system. 

* Some of the essential functions of a package manager are:

   1. Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the package by verifying their digital certificates and checksums. This is to ensure that the package is downloaded from  a trusted source and safe to install. 
   2. Simplifying the entire package management process, most package managers provide powerful querying options, making it easier to look up packages and then downloading, installing, or updating existing software
